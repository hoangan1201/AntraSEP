ideas: 
- gameboard component
- use 2d array to represent matrix
- when click on column, add color to lowest index of that column.

- minimum 4 max 10 for dimension

logic:
- drop 1 coin
- check surroundings to find match
- check if enough 4 in a row
- from the coin dropped, use check back and forth for 3 directions
